Brief Introduction About Myself 
My name is Rodrigue Anboan Some, I'm a passionate and creative student entrepreneur who desires to solve real-world problems through innovation and technology. 
My journey began with a deep interest in how cities function and people's everyday struggles within rapidly urbanizing environments. 
With a background in software and cloud computing, I decided to channel my skills into creating practical solutions that bridge the gap between citizens and city planners.
UrbanFlow is the result of my commitment to improving urban life by making reporting and responding to infrastructure issues faster, smarter, and more community-centered. Through this project, 
I’ve explored user research, prototyping, and social innovation, and I’m excited to continue building a solution that empowers urban communities and supports sustainable development.
